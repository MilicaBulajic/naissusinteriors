##
<b>TEMPLATING:</b> Our technicians will arrive at the job site to take accurate measurements of the areas receiving stone treatment.

<b>FABRICATION:</b> During the fabrication process, our experienced cutting specialists are required to make decisions about where to place any necessary seams. Our technicians are instructed to keep these seams to a minimum while maximizing the use of the slab. We will also work to align the veining at the seams in order to achieve the most aesthetically pleasing placement. You can be present during the layout of your templates/measurements on the slabs in order to better understand the process and see exactly what you will be receiving at installation.

<b>INSTALLATION:</b> Our installers will arrive at the job site as early as possible. Our installers are artists. They must install stone that is difficult to manipulate and create a piece that is visually stunning. We strive to be diplomatic and pleasant when installing your chosen stone.
When your stone has been installed and cleaned, we will apply a sealer to the surface of your new tops. Before our technicians leave the job site, they will be certain that the work area is as clean as when they arrived.
